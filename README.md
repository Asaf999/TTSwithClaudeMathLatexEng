MathSpeak is a powerful Text-to-Speech (TTS) system designed specifically for mathematical expressions. It converts LaTeX mathematical notation into natural, understandable speech.

## Features

- 🎯 **Full LaTeX Support** - Handles complex mathematical expressions
- 🗣️ **Natural Speech** - Context-aware pronunciation for clarity
- 🚀 **High Performance** - Sub-10ms response time with caching
- 🔒 **Security Built-in** - Protection against malicious LaTeX
- 🌐 **REST API** - Easy integration with any application
- 🔄 **Real-time Streaming** - Process math as you type
- 🐳 **Docker Ready** - Deploy anywhere in minutes
- 🔌 **Offline Mode** - Works without internet connection

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mathspeak.git
cd mathspeak

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install MathSpeak
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Command line
ms "The integral is $\int_0^1 x^2 dx$"

# With audio output
ms -a "The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$"

# Python API
from mathspeak import MathSpeak
ms = MathSpeak()
text = ms.speak("$E = mc^2$")  # Returns: "E equals m c squared"
```

### Docker

```bash
# Using Docker
docker run -p 8000:8000 mathspeak

# Using Docker Compose
docker-compose up
```
