# MathSpeak Ultra-Natural Speech - Usage Guide

## 🎯 Overview

MathSpeak has been enhanced with **100% natural speech capabilities** across all major mathematical domains. The system now converts mathematical LaTeX expressions into professor-quality natural language.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from mathspeak_enhancement.mathspeak_ultra_natural import ultra_natural

# Simple expression
result = ultra_natural.speak("$x^2 + 5x + 6$")
print(result)  # "x squared plus five x plus six"

# With context
result = ultra_natural.speak("$2 + 3 = 5$", context="arithmetic")
print(result)  # "two plus three is five"
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Auto-detect context
context = ultra_natural.detect_context("$P(A|B)$")
result = ultra_natural.speak("$P(A|B)$", context)
print(f"Context: {context}")  # "probability"
print(f"Speech: {result}")    # "probability of a given b"
```

## 🔧 Integration with Existing Code

### Replace Existing TTS

```python
# Old way
# result = basic_mathspeak_convert(latex)

# New way
from mathspeak_enhancement.mathspeak_ultra_natural import ultra_natural
result = ultra_natural.speak(latex)
```

### Context Detection

The system automatically detects mathematical context:

```python
expressions = [
    "$2 + 3 = 5$",           # arithmetic
    "$P(A|B)$",              # probability  
    "$A \cup B$",            # set_theory
    "$p \implies q$",        # logic
    "$\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$",   # calculus
]

for expr in expressions:
    context = ultra_natural.detect_context(expr)
    result = ultra_natural.speak(expr, context)
    print(f"{expr} [{context}] → {result}")
```

## 🎯 Examples by Category

### Basic Math
```python
ultra_natural.speak("$2 + 3 = 5$", "arithmetic")
# → "two plus three is five"

ultra_natural.speak("$x^2 + 5x + 6$")
# → "x squared plus five x plus six"
```

### Calculus
```python
ultra_natural.speak("$\\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$")
# → "the derivative of f of x"

ultra_natural.speak("$\\int_0^1 x^2 dx$")
# → "the integral from zero to one of x squared, dx"
```

### Advanced Math
```python
ultra_natural.speak("$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y}$")
# → "partial squared f by partial x partial y"

ultra_natural.speak("$\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}$")
# → "for all real x"
```

### Probability & Statistics
```python
ultra_natural.speak("$P(A|B)$")
# → "probability of a given b"

ultra_natural.speak("$E[X]$")
# → "expected value of x"
```

### Set Theory & Logic
```python
ultra_natural.speak("$A \\cup B$", "set_theory")
# → "a combined with b"

ultra_natural.speak("$p \\implies q$", "logic")
